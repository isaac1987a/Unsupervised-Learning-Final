    "# Hate Speach Detection\n",
    "I want to build an algorithim to detect hate speach.  This will use the Hate Speach and Offensive Language dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset?select=labeled_data.csv.  This dataset is 24782 tweets long with users voting on if the tweet is offensive, hate_speach or neither, with the winning label being selected as a class.\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "I will approach this as a text classification problem similar to the BBC problem.  The big difference is that my text can be labeled as either hate speach, or offensive language.  Users were allowed to vote on which category the data fell into but were only permitted to select 1 category when multiple may apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to move the count to a boolean selection.  If either hate speach or offensive language have more than 1/3 of the count, it will be 1, otherwise it will be 0.  After I perform NMF, I will use various models to bucket the new text.  For classification, I will generate an expected value and test various cutoffs for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer\n",
    "This assignment necissarly contains hate speach, and offensive langauge.  This does not represent the views of the author."
